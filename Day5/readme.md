Types of data

Variables and its types

quantitative : A variable that can be measured numerically is called a quantitative data. the data collected on a quantitative variable is called quant data

a variable whose values are countable are called discrete data. whole numbers 

continuous data: numerical value that can be over a certain interval

Qualitative: Can be described in a non-numerical categories is called qualitative data

nominal - with no priority order like menu of beverages
ordinal - with certain priority order like size of portion small med large

interval and ration continuous variables have values with a logical order and relative distance between vales  are meaningful 

ratio have zero point
interval do not have zero point can go from neg to pos like temperature -100C to 100C so no zero no limiting value.


Data- Descriptive data(collect, classify, present, interpret, represent)- Central tendency- how data varies from the center and Level of Dispersion - relation of data in between itself, measure of dispersion of data

Central Tendency -- 
-- Mean -- median -- mode -- outliers
mean is most reliable


Level of Dispersion
-- Standard Deviation Variance


-- range = [max - min ]


-- skewness -- symmetrical data -- mean == mode == median
        pearson coefficent = ( mean - mode / standard deviation)
            for symmetrical dataset - pc = 0
            for unsymmetrical => pc = -3 to 3 inclusive 
            negatively skewed-> concentrated bending towards left and positively skewed-> beniding towards right
            mode < median < mean


-- quartiles
